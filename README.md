````
Flink, NiFi, Kafka, 
Streaming stack in perfect sync, 
Data flows like wind.

The flank stack flows 
Data like water through a pipe, 
Efficient and fast.

A stream of data 
From here to there and back again 
In real time, with ease

Flank stack in motion 
Flink, Nifi, Kafka in sync 
Data flow at its best

Flink, NiFi, Kafka 
A powerful streaming stack 
For your data needs

A stream of data flows
Through the Apache Flink stack
Kafka and NiFi too

Flink, NiFi, and Kafka
The holy trinity of data
Stream processing bliss

Flink, NiFi, Kafka
A powerful streaming stack
For all your needs.
